# Welcome
Welcome
The following repository will contain several different environment templates implementing various JavaScript frameworks in the development of copley@Next.


# React Version
The first template setup is [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).  There are currently two repositories.  

##[ReactWebpack](https://github.com/LincolnGroup/v-Next/tree/master/ReactWebpack)
This is a very simple structure, with a step by step guide to setup the environment.   Over the next couple of days, I will be implementing more technology, and structures into this template.

##[ReactWebpackMaterial-UI](https://github.com/LincolnGroup/v-Next/tree/master/ReactWebpackMaterial-UI)
This repository is an experiment implementing the following:
* [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
* [React/Redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/UsageWithReact.html)
* [Chaijs](http://chaijs.com/)
* [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/)
* [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com)

Once finished vetting each technology, if the technology fits our needs, they will be integrated into the ReactWebpack template. The documentation will reflect how to implement each technology.  [ReactWebpack](https://github.com/LincolnGroup/v-Next/tree/master/ReactWebpack) readme file.
