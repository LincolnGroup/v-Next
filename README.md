# Welcome
This repository is a compilation of my researching React & Angular Frameworks.  The end goal is to implement and demonstrate the usage of each client side enviornment, the testing and the team integration.

# React Version
I have been examing the react version this week.  

[ReactWebpack](https://github.com/LincolnGroup/v-Next/tree/master/ReactWebpack)
I first wanted to spin up the enviornment, and just get a basic structure in place.  

[ReactWebpackMaterial-UI](https://github.com/LincolnGroup/v-Next/tree/master/ReactWebpackMaterial-UI)
This repository is an experiment in implementing [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com), playing Redux, and implementing a testing framework.  Once I finish orginizing this structure, I will start pulling in the features into the ReactWebpack repository. It will ultimatly be accompanied with step by step instructions setting up the enviornment.  If you refer to [ReactWebpack](https://github.com/LincolnGroup/v-Next/tree/master/ReactWebpack) readme file.
