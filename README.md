# Welcome
This is a repository that is a compilation of my findings research React/Angular.  I am creating several implementations to demonstrate the future client side enviornment, that the team will implement.

# React Version
I have been examing the react version this week.  I first wanted to spin up the enviornment, and just get a basic structure in place.  The second repository is more of a scratch disk, it is just an experiment in implementing [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com).

This will work nicely. Next step is integrate it in the simpler example. Once that is done, I will use it the react template.
